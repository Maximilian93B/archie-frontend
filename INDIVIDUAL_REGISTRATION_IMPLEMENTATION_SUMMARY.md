- ✅ Supports HTTP for localhost, HTTPS for production
- ✅ Displays generated subdomain with copy functionality

### 3. **OAuth Integration**
- ✅ Updated OAuth signup to pass registration type
- ✅ Stores registration type and company in sessionStorage
- ✅ Passes parameters to backend OAuth endpoint

### 4. **Post-Registration Flow**
- ✅ Flexible redirect strategy implemented
- ✅ Default: Redirect to pricing page
- ✅ Alternative: Direct subdomain redirect (commented option)

### 5. **E2E Test Script**
- ✅ Created comprehensive test script (`test-auth-e2e.js`)
- ✅ Tests individual registration
- ✅ Tests organization registration
- ✅ Tests login with subdomain
- ✅ Tests subdomain recovery

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Registration Flow
```
User → Choose Type → Fill Form → Submit
         ↓
Backend creates tenant with subdomain
         ↓
Success Screen → Shows subdomain → Continue to Pricing
```

### Login Flow
```
User → Enter Subdomain → Enter Credentials → Submit
         ↓
API Client adds X-Tenant-Subdomain header
         ↓
Backend validates → Returns JWT → Dashboard
```

## 📝 Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Start backend with Docker
3. Test individual registration:
   - Go to `/auth/register`
   - Select "Individual"
   - Fill form and submit
   - Verify subdomain displayed
4. Test organization registration:
   - Select "Organization"
   - Enter company name
   - Verify subdomain preview
5. Test login with subdomain
6. Test subdomain recovery

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Install puppeteer if needed
npm install --save-dev puppeteer

# Run E2E tests
node test-auth-e2e.js
```

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN` to production domain
   - Ensure all Stripe price IDs are correct
   - Verify API URL points to production backend

2. **DNS Configuration**
   - Wildcard subdomain support (*.archivus.app)
   - SSL certificate for wildcard domain
   - Proper CORS configuration

3. **Security**
   - HTTPS required for production
   - Secure token storage
   - Rate limiting on registration

## 📊 Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | Individual | Organization |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Custom Subdomain | ✅ Auto-generated | ✅ Company-based |
| Admin Role | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Multi-User | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Pricing | Individual Plan | Starter/Pro/Enterprise |
| OAuth Support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Run E2E test script
   - Test with actual backend
   - Verify subdomain redirects

2. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add subdomain validation
   - Implement subdomain availability check
   - Add loading states during registration
   - Enhanced error messaging

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Update environment variables
   - Test with production domain
   - Verify SSL/HTTPS
   - Monitor registration metrics

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ Individual users can register with auto-generated subdomains
- ✅ Organizations can register with company-based subdomains
- ✅ Users can log in using their subdomain
- ✅ Subdomain recovery works via email
- ✅ OAuth maintains registration type
- ✅ All API calls include tenant headers

## 🐛 Known Considerations

1. **Local Development**
   - Subdomain routing doesn't work on localhost
   - Use subdomain field in login form for testing
   - Consider using a tool like `lvh.me` for local subdomain testing

2. **OAuth Callback**
   - Ensure backend passes subdomain in OAuth callback
   - Frontend stores registration type in sessionStorage
   - May need to handle edge cases for OAuth errors
