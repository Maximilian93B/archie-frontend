# üîç AI Enhanced Search - Feature Guide

## What is AI Enhanced Search?

AI Enhanced Search transforms traditional keyword matching into **semantic search that understands meaning**. Instead of just finding documents that contain specific words, it understands the intent behind search queries and finds conceptually relevant content even when exact keywords don't match.

## Core Capabilities

### üß† **Semantic Understanding**
- **Intent Recognition**: AI analyzes what users are really looking for
- **Concept Matching**: Finds documents about concepts, not just keywords
- **Context Awareness**: Understands search queries in the context of the workspace
- **Synonym Recognition**: Automatically includes related terms and concepts

### üìä **Intelligent Relevance Scoring**
- **Semantic Similarity**: Documents are scored based on conceptual relevance
- **Content Analysis**: AI considers document summaries, key points, and full text
- **Relationship Weighting**: Related documents get relevance boosts
- **Quality Factors**: Processing confidence affects relevance scoring

### üéØ **Advanced Search Features**
- **Query Analysis**: Breaks down search queries to understand entities and themes
- **Result Grouping**: Groups related results by themes or topics
- **Content Highlighting**: Shows relevant sections with confidence scores
- **Search Suggestions**: Provides intelligent query suggestions and refinements

### üîç **Multi-Modal Search**
- **Full-Text Search**: Searches document content and extracted text
- **AI Summary Search**: Searches AI-generated summaries and key points
- **Metadata Search**: Includes tags, categories, and other metadata
- **Relationship Search**: Finds documents based on connections to other documents

## Key Data Points

### Enhanced Search Response
Each search result includes:

- **Standard Document Data**: Title, type, size, dates, permissions
- **Relevance Score**: Semantic similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Highlighted Content**: Relevant sections with markup
- **AI Summary**: Context-aware summary of why this document matches
- **Matching Sections**: Specific parts of the document that match
- **Confidence Scores**: How confident the AI is about each match

### Query Analysis
For each search, you receive:
- **Detected Intent**: What the AI thinks the user is looking for
- **Extracted Entities**: People, places, concepts mentioned in the query
- **Identified Themes**: Main topics or subjects
- **Suggested Refinements**: Ways to improve or narrow the search

### Result Organization
Search results can be organized by:
- **Relevance Score**: Traditional ranking by matching strength
- **Thematic Groups**: Documents grouped by related topics
- **Document Types**: Organized by file type or content category
- **Processing Quality**: Grouped by AI analysis confidence
