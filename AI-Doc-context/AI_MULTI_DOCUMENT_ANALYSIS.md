# üîó AI Multi-Document Analysis - Feature Guide

## What is Multi-Document Analysis?

Multi-Document Analysis enables **cross-document intelligence** that identifies relationships, patterns, and themes across multiple documents simultaneously. Instead of analyzing documents in isolation, it understands how documents relate to each other and provides insights about document collections.

## Core Capabilities

### üîç **Relationship Detection**
- **Thematic Connections**: Identifies documents that share similar themes or topics
- **Content Overlap**: Finds documents with overlapping information or concepts
- **Sequential Relationships**: Detects documents that build upon each other
- **Hierarchical Connections**: Identifies parent-child or dependency relationships

### üìä **Pattern Analysis**
- **Content Patterns**: Identifies recurring themes, topics, or structures
- **Temporal Patterns**: Analyzes how content evolves over time
- **Structural Patterns**: Finds similar document formats or organizations
- **Usage Patterns**: Identifies how documents are accessed and used together

### üéØ **Comparative Analysis**
- **Content Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of document content
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing information or topics
- **Duplicate Detection**: Finds similar or redundant content
- **Evolution Tracking**: Shows how concepts or topics change across documents

### üìù **Synthesis Capabilities**
- **Cross-Document Summaries**: Creates summaries that span multiple documents
- **Theme Extraction**: Identifies common themes across document collections
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combines insights from multiple sources
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies trends and patterns across documents

## Key Data Points

### Analysis Types
The system supports four primary analysis types:

- **Relationships**: Focus on how documents connect and relate to each other
- **Themes**: Identify common topics and concepts across documents
- **Summary**: Generate comprehensive summaries spanning multiple documents
- **Comparison**: Direct comparison between selected documents

### Analysis Response
Each analysis provides:

- **Analysis Summary**: Overview of findings across all documents
- **Key Themes**: 5-10 main themes identified across the document collection
- **Document Relationships**: Specific connections between document pairs
- **Detected Patterns**: Recurring elements or structures found
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions based on the analysis
- **Confidence Scores**: How confident the AI is in each finding

### Relationship Data
Document relationships include:
- **Relationship Type**: Thematic, sequential, hierarchical, or complementary
- **Strength Score**: How strong the relationship is (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Description**: Natural language explanation of the connection
- **Evidence**: Specific content that supports the relationship

### Pattern Information
Detected patterns include:
- **Pattern Type**: Content, structural, temporal, or usage-based
- **Frequency**: How often the pattern appears
- **Significance**: How important the pattern is
- **Examples**: Specific instances where the pattern occurs
